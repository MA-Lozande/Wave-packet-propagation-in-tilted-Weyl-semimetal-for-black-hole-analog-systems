# Wave-packet-propagation-in-tilted-Weyl-semimetal-for-black-hole-analog-systems
Numerical codes (RK4 and WKB) fpr simulating wave packet propagation in tilted Weyl semimetal as analogs for black hole event horizons. This investigates horizon physics including wave packet freezing, transmission/reflection and the role of dwell time.
